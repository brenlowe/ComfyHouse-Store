# Comfy House Store

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, CMS (Contentful).

This project was my first attempt at an e-commerce store following John Smilga's tutorial on freeCodeCamp. This was a great way for me to understand and implement concepts I've been learning about through a course. I kept files and folders structured and organized with a full responsive design. The cart and products featured have full CRUD functionality with some simple vanilla javascript logic.
